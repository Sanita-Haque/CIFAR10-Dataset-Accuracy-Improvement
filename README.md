# CIFAR10-Dataset-Accuracy-Improvement

The purpose of this project is to improve the accuracy of the CIFAR-10 dataset. To improve this accuracy, we need to build a new CNN model. The new proposed model is called “ImprovedLeNet”. The CIFAR-10 dataset comprises 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The revised model architecture incorporated several key modifications, including additional convolutional layers, smaller kernel sizes, batch normalization, and dropout layers. These changes were strategically implemented to capture more complex features in the images and to regularize the model for better generalization. During the training process, techniques like data augmentation, dynamic learning rates, and experimenting with the “RMSProp” optimizer. The enhanced model demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy compared to the standard LeNet (Used in HW-06) architecture.
